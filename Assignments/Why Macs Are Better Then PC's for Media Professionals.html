#Why Macs Are Better Then PC's for Media Professionals.
##By: Nick Welsh
There is an ongoing war about which operating system is better, Mac or Windows. There is no perfect operating system, just good operating systems for specific uses. For example, Windows is the best for gaming as it has the most games and best performance for the price. Macs, however, are better for media professionals with the workstation grade hardware, ease of use, and super fast connections. Let's tale a closer look.

First of all, Macs are made by Apple. Every mac. Apple controls both the hardware and software so that they work hand in hand. This means you get a great experience, something Windows can't offer as Microsoft only makes the software, not the hardware. The Macs have top of the line design and are made from good materials, not plastic. Apple is known for good and interesting designs. The Macs are designed to look nice and work well.

Media professionals need their computers to be fast. Really fast. Mac's are fast. Every computer used something called a hard drive. It is a part of your computer that stores everything. The only issue with hard drives is they are mechanical. They have spinning platters and a reader, kinda like a CD. They can be destroyed with magnets as hard drives are a magnetic storage device. So, not only are they prone to fail, but they can be slow. Macs however come with, or have to option to come with, an SSD. SSD, or Solid State Disk, is like a hard drive as it stores information, but the way it does it is different. There are no moving parts nor is it magnetic storage. It's less prone to fail and it's fast. Really fast. It works like a circuit board. This allows you to open your apps and files really fast.

In addition to SSD's instead of HDD, or hard drive disks, macs come with Thunderbolt 2. Thunderbolt is a technology made by Intel. It's like USB, the thing that looks like a duck mouth. The thing you plug your flash drive into. Yes, that. That is USB. It's a bit slow. USB 2.0 is the most common. USB 3.0 is faster. You can't really tell the difference between the two. Usually USB 3.0 ports are blue. Every file on your computer takes up space. File sizes are measured in bites. The more bites, the larger the file. A terabyte is larger than a gigabyte, which is larger than a megabyte, which is larger than a kilobyte. 100 kilobytes is a gigabyte, 1000 gigabytes is a terabyte. This is important to know because the larger the file, the longer it takes to copy. Most USB devices can transfer about 50 megabytes in a second. Newer drives can move a bit more than half a gigabyte a second. Thunderbolt 2 can move 2.5 gigabytes a second. That is crazy fast. This allows media professionals to quickly move files from one drive to another. Not to mention 1 cable can connect you to all of your drives and displays.

Apple has an app called Final Cut Pro X. It's a professional video editor that is easy to use. Because it is made by Apple, it is designed to tale complete advantage of the hardware in your Mac so that it will run smoothly. This is great if you are just starting out. It can also run some other high end apps, such as the Adobe creative suite and Cinema 4D. You can get your work done and make it look good.

Microsoft, only makes Windows, not the computers. They don't make any editing software. They just have an operating system. There is only a small handful of windows computers that have Thunderbolt. Most Windows computers are large, clunky and not attractive to look at. They require a lot of work to keep up and running smoothly. They will need plenty of wires to connect to all of your drives and displays. Macs look nice, intergrade with the software, don't need a ton of upkeep, and only require a minimal amount of cables.

As you can see, Macs are clearly the better choice for media professionals. They run much more smoothly and integrate perfectly with the software. Apple pays great attention to detail. They control every aspect of the computer so that it will work. This will allow you to have the computer get out of the way and allow you to get your work done.
